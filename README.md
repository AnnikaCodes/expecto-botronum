## Technical
Expecto Botronum is written in Python 3.x (specifically, Python 3.6). If you would like to contribute, feel free to work on one of the issues. To propose a feature, PM me on Discord (Annika#1562) or mention the feature in the channel for that purpose in the Magic & Mayhem discord.

To run Expecto Botronum, simply clone the source code, install dependencies (with `pip install -r requirements.txt`), copy `config-example.json` to `config.json` and edit it as needed, and run `core.py`. You can also run the script `test.sh` (on Linux and Mac) to run the linter and tests, if you're so inclined.

Further technical documentation is available in [v3.md](https://github.com/AnnikaCodes/expecto-botronum/blob/master/v3.md).
