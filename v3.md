# Expecto Botronum v3
### A Pokemon Showdown! bot written in Python 3.x by Annika for the Magic & Mayhem room.

Legend: normal text, *WIP ideas for ways to implement things*, `code or names`.

The bot must be able to run on Python 3.6.9 under Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (host requirements). I (Annika) retain sole control over the design; if you would like to contribute, feel free to get in touch with me on GitHub ([AnnikaCodes](github.com/AnnikaCodes) is the account I use for PS! stuff), Discord (Annika#1562), or on Pokemon Showdown! (Annika).

This document is also hosted in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWEAj5v1B0rz8uCc8g5iKsQgea4ymJ-VZNLSn8yjX4Q/edit).

Expecto Botronum is based on the [ps-client Python package](https://pypi.org/project/ps-client/) that I wrote.

#### Files:
- `core.py`
  - contains the `BotConnection` class and logic to start the bot and establish the connection
  - loads commands and is responsible for executing them
- `config.py`
  - loads `config.json`
- `config.json`
  - contains JSONized `config.config`, the only user-modifiable configuration variable.
- `data.json`
  - Contains all data storage, in the form of a dictionary of the form `{<variable name>: <value>}`
- `data.py`
  - Contains helper functions for storing variables to `data.json`.
- `base.py`
  - Contains the `base` module.
  - Basic commands: `~pong`, `~timer`, `~owo`, `~eval`, and `~do`.
- `superhero.py`
  - Contains the superhero module that interacts with the Superhero API
  - Commands: `~superhero`.
- `joinphrase.py`
  - Contains the `joinphrase` module.
  - Commands: `~joinphrase` (`~jp`), `~clearjoinphrase` (`~clearjp`).
- `games.py`
  - Contains the `games` module, which starts games and can keep score.
  - Commands: `~reverse` (`~wallrev`), `~tour`, `~uno`, `~scores`, `~addto`, `~clearscores`.
- `conversation.py`
  - Contains the `conversation` module, which keeps track of facts and topics
  - Commands: `~fact`, `~addfact`, `~deletefact` (`~removefact`), `~countfacts` (`~factcount`), `~listfacts` (`~factlist`), `~topic`, `~addtopic`,` ~deletetopic` (`~removetopic`), `~counttopics` (`~topiccount`), `~listtopics` (`~topiclist`)
  - Since facts and topics are the same thing, we probably should reuse the logic - maybe find a way to do this with the same logic
    - *maybe something like how PS commands work, where the same function is called but functions differently based on the `BotMessage` object passed?*

#### Classes:
- `BotConnection` extends `psclient.PSConnection`
  - `.commands`
    - Dictionary mapping phrases to methods (from the `Module`s). Automatically built from the `Module`s loaded as described in `config.json`.
  - `.modules`
    - a set of all modules currently known to be loaded
- `Message` extends `psclient.Message`
  - `.arguments`
    - a list consisting of the message split up by `config.separator` (default: `,`), is equal to `None` if there is no body
  - `.respond(message)`
    - responds to the message: in the room if the User can broadcast or in PMs if the command was in PMs
- `BotRoom` extends `psclient.Room`
  - `.joinphrases`
    - a dictionary of the room's joinphrases
  - `.addJoinphrase(phrase, userid)`
    - adds a joinphrase
  - `.removeJoinphrase(userid)`
    - removes the joinphrase of the user with the given ID
- `BotUser` extends `psclient.User`
  - `.can(action, room)`
    - returns a boolean based on whether or not the user can do the given action in the given `Room` object.
    - if ``Room`` is ``None`` or not provided, do a thing, I don’t know exactly what yet.
    - Possible actions: `‘broadcast’`, `‘addfact’`, `‘hostgame’`, `'searchlog'`, `'wall'`, `'html'`, `‘manage’`, `‘admin’`.
- `Module`
  - `.commands`
    - a dictionary mapping commands to functions.
    - Example for `superhero.py`: `{‘superhero’: self.superhero, ‘sh’: self.superhero}`
    - Methods for executing the commands
The built-in chatlogger (`psclient.chatlog.Chatlogger`) from the `ps-client` package is used.
A word about logging: there are four `config.loglevel`s: `0`: log only errors; `1`: log errors and warnings; `2`: log errors, warnings, and info; and `3`: log errors, warnings, and debug messages. `core.log()` automates this.
Expecto Botronum is based on the `ps-client` package; [its documentation](https://ps-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) may be helpful as well :)
