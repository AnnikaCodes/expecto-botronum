# Expecto Botronum v3
### A Pokemon Showdown! bot written in Python 3.x by Annika for the Magic & Mayhem room.

Legend: normal text, *WIP ideas for ways to implement things*, `code or names`.

The bot must be able to run on Python 3.5.3 under Debian Stretch (host requirements). I (Annika) retain sole control over the design; if you would like to contribute, feel free to get in touch with me on GitHub ([AnnikaCodes](github.com/AnnikaCodes) is the account I use for PS! stuff), Discord (Annika#1562), or on Pokemon Showdown! (Annika).

#### Files:
- `core.py`
  - contains the `Connection` class and logic to start the bot and establish the connection
  - loads commands and is responsible for executing them
  - *idea for how to load commands: each module exports a dictionary mapping phrases (the commands) to `Command` objects which `Connection` then looks for in each message*
  - contains the `Message`, `Room`, and `User` classes, which are passed into commands
    - determining auth in the room(s)
    - `User.can(‘action’)`
  - If logging is desired, this is where it’d be.
  - Joinphrase logic would also have to go here.
- `config.py`
  - loads `config.json`
- `config.json`
  - contains JSONized `config.config`, the only user-modifiable configuration variable.
- `data.json`
  - Contains all data storage, in the form of a dictionary of the form `{<variable name>: <value>}`
- `data.py`
  - Contains helper functions for storing variables to `data.json`.
- `base.py`
  - Contains the `base` module.
  - Basic commands: `~pong`, `~timer`, `~owo`, `~eval`, and `~do`.
- `superhero.py`
  - Contains the superhero module that interacts with the Superhero API
  - Commands: `~superhero`.
- `joinphrase.py`
  - Contains the `joinphrase` module.
  - Commands: `~joinphrase` (`~jp`), `~clearjoinphrase` (`~clearjp`).
- `games.py`
  - Contains the `games` module, which starts games and can keep score.
  - Commands: `~reverse` (`~wallrev`), `~tour`, `~uno`, `~scores`, `~addto`, `~clearscores`.
- `conversation.py`
  - Contains the `conversation` module, which keeps track of facts and topics
  - Commands: `~fact`, `~addfact`, `~deletefact` (`~removefact`), `~countfacts` (`~factcount`), `~listfacts` (`~factlist`), `~topic`, `~addtopic`,` ~deletetopic` (`~removetopic`), `~counttopics` (`~topiccount`), `~listtopics` (`~topiclist`)
  - Since facts and topics are the same thing, we probably should reuse the logic - maybe find a way to do this with the same logic
    - *maybe something like how PS commands work, where the same function is called but functions differently based on the `Message` object passed?*

#### Classes:
- `Connection`
  - `.send(string message)`
    - directly sends something across the websocket
  - `.sayIn(string room, string message)`
    - sends the given message to the given room
  - `.whisper(string user, string message)`
    - PMs the given message to the given user
  - `__init__()`
    - sets up the connection
  - `.commands`
    - Dictionary mapping phrases to methods (from the `Module`s). Automatically built from the `Module`s loaded as described in `config.json`.
  - `.bot`
    - a `User` object corresponding to Expecto Botronum's user
  - `.chatlogger`
    - the `Chatlogger` object being used to log chat
  - `.login(challstr)`
    - logs in
  - `.getRoomByID(roomid)`
    - returns a `Room` object corresponding to the given ID, if the `Connection` is connected to that room
  - `.getRoomByName(roomname)`
    - returns a `Room` object but by name not by ID
  - `.getUserRooms(user)`
    - returns a list of the roomids the given user is in
  - `.getUser(userid)`
    - gets the `User` object for the given ID
  - `.userLeftRoom(user, room)`
    - handles users leaving a room
  - `.userJoinedRoom(user, room)`
    - handles users joining a room
  - probably other stuff that i'm not thinking of
  - when a message is recieved/parsed into a `Message` object, if the user has a different rank in the room it should be updated in `Room.auth`
- `Message`
  - `.sender`
    - a `User` object describing the user who sent the message
  - `.senderName`
    - the name (not ID) of the user who sent the message. Includes the user's rank, if any.
  - `.arguments`
    - a list consisting of the message split up by `config.separator` (default: `,`), is equal to `None` if there is no body
  - `.room`
    - a `Room` object for the room the message was sent in. if the message was sent to Expecto Botronum in PMs, `Message.room` will equal `None`.
    - *[this allows for things like `if message.room: roomStuff() else: PMStuff()`]*
  - `.body`
    - the message’s contents, equal to `None` if there is no body
  - `.time`
    - the timestamp of the message, if there is one, in unix time, else `None`.
  - `.type`
    - The message type. One of: `‘init’`, `‘title’`, `‘users’`, `‘html’`, `‘uhtml’`, `‘uhtmlchange’`, **`‘join’`**, `‘leave’`, `‘namechange`, **`‘chat’`**, `‘battle’`, **`‘popup’`**, **`‘pm’`**, ‘`usercount’`, `‘nametaken’`, **`‘challstr’`**, `‘updateuser’`, `‘updatesearch’`, `‘updatechallenges’`, `‘queryresponse’`, or `‘tournaments’`. (This is a complete representation of all PS! protocol messages - only the **bold** types are required for Expecto Botronum’s function.)
  - `.challstr`
    - if the message type is `‘challstr’`, this is the challstr.
  - `.respond(message)`
    - responds to the message: in the room if the User can broadcast or in PMs if the command was in PMs
- `Room`
  - `.say(message)`
    - sends the message to the room
  - `.leave()`
    - leaves the room
  - `.join()`
    - joins the room
  - `.usersWithRankGEQ(rank)`
    - returns a set of userids corresponding to the roomauth whose room rank is greater than or equal to the given `rank`
  - `.updateAuth(dict)`
    - applies `dict` to the room's auth list
  - `.auth`
    - a dictionary that has all the room’s auth; as an example: ``Room(“magicmayhem”).auth = {‘+’: [‘birdy’, ‘captanpasta’, ‘iwouldprefernotto’, ‘madmonty’, ‘nui, ‘xprienzo’], ‘%’: [‘dawnofares’, ‘instruct’, ‘kie’, ‘oaklynnthylacine’, ‘pirateprincess’, ‘ratisweep’, ‘watfor’], ‘@’: [‘darth’, ‘gwynt’, ‘miapi’, ‘profsapling’, ‘ravioliqueen’], ‘*’: [‘expectobotronum’, ‘kida’], ‘#’: [‘annika’, ‘awa’, ‘cleo’, ‘meicoo’]}``
    - *there’s probably a better way to do this than parsing popups like YALS-B - reworking auth handling would be better. Perhaps look at other bots and how they do it.* (see issue #14)
  - `.joinphrases`
    - a dictionary of the room's joinphrases
  - `.addJoinphrase(phrase, userid)`
    - adds a joinphrase
  - `.removeJoinphrase(userid)`
    - removes the joinphrase of the user with the given ID
- `User`
  - `.name`
    - the name of the user
  - `.id`
    - the user’s ID (i.e. from the message `|c|#Annika ^_^|hi :D`, `User.name` would be `“Annika ^_^”` and `User.id` would be `“annika”`
  - `.can(action, room)`
    - returns a boolean based on whether or not the user can do the given action in the given `Room` object.
    - if ``Room`` is ``None`` or not provided, do a thing, I don’t know exactly what yet.
    - Possible actions: `‘broadcast’`, `‘addfact’`, `‘hostgame’`, `'searchlog'`, `'wall'`, `'html'`, `‘manage’`, `‘admin’`.
  - `.isAdmin`
    - `True` if the user is configured to be admin. If this is true, `User.can()` will always return `True`.
- `Module`
  - `.commands`
    - a dictionary mapping commands to functions.
    - Example for `superhero.py`: `{‘superhero’: self.superhero, ‘sh’: self.superhero}`
    - Methods for executing the commands
- `Chatlogger`
  - `.path`
    - the path to the base logging directory
  - `.handleMessage(message)`
    - handles logging a message
  - `.getFile(roomid, perms)`
    - gets a file object to log messages in the room with id `roomid` and returns it opened with `perms`
  - `.formatMessage(message)`
    - formats a message into raw data format: `userid|time|type|senderName|body`
  - `.search(self, roomid="", userid="", keyword="", includeJoins=False)`
    - searches for logged messages
  - `.formatData(self, data, isHTML=False)`
    - formats a logged message that is in the format `userid|time|type|senderName|body`.
    - for example: `annika|1591322849|chat|#Annika|hi!` => `[02:07:29] #Annika: hi!`
      - (`<small>[02:07:29]</small> <small>#</small><b>Annika</b>: hi!` if `isHTML` is True)

A word about logging: there are four `config.loglevel`s: `0`: log only errors; `1`: log errors and warnings; `2`: log errors, warnings, and info; and `3`: log errors, warnings, and debug messages. `core.log()` automates this.
I’m probably missing something big here, but that’s a basic start. I’ll probably work on this more later and actually start coding
